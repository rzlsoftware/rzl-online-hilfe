# Deferred Accessibility & UX Enhancements

These items were postponed from the search plan and can be implemented after core filtering is in place:

- Add keyboard support for opening the program filter and changing selection within the search dialog.
- Provide a clear “Filter by program” label and an explicit reset/clear option.
- Revisit visual affordances (focus states, hover, toggle icon) to align with the theme while keeping the filter unobtrusive.
